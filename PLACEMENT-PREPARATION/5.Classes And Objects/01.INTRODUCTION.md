You are correct. In C, structures have several limitations that prevent them from being used as flexibly as built-in data types. Specifically:

1. **Lack of Direct Arithmetic Operations**:
   - C structures do not support arithmetic operations directly. You cannot add, subtract, multiply, or divide structures like you can with built-in types (e.g., integers, floats).

2. **No Built-in Comparison Operators**:
   - Structures cannot be compared using the `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, or `>=` operators. You need to write your own functions to compare structures.

3. **Initialization Limitations**:
   - Initializing structures can be cumbersome, especially for nested structures or arrays of structures. There is no shorthand equivalent to `int x = 5;` for structures.

4. **Function Parameter Passing**:
   - Structures are typically passed by value to functions, which means the entire structure is copied. This can be inefficient for large structures. To avoid this, structures are often passed by pointer, which requires additional code to handle memory management.

Let's delve deeper into these limitations and explore possible workarounds or solutions.

### Example of Limitations

#### 1. Arithmetic Operations

In C, you cannot directly perform arithmetic operations on structures:

```c
struct Point {
    int x;
    int y;
};

struct Point p1 = {1, 2};
struct Point p2 = {3, 4};

// This will cause a compilation error
// struct Point p3 = p1 + p2;
```

To perform arithmetic operations on structures, you need to write custom functions:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

struct Point {
    int x;
    int y;
};

struct Point addPoints(struct Point p1, struct Point p2) {
    struct Point result;
    result.x = p1.x + p2.x;
    result.y = p1.y + p2.y;
    return result;
}

int main() {
    struct Point p1 = {1, 2};
    struct Point p2 = {3, 4};
    struct Point p3 = addPoints(p1, p2);

    printf("p3: (%d, %d)\n", p3.x, p3.y);
    return 0;
}
```

#### 2. Comparison Operators

Similarly, comparison operators are not defined for structures:

```c
struct Point p1 = {1, 2};
struct Point p2 = {3, 4};

// This will cause a compilation error
// if (p1 == p2) { ... }
```

You need to write a function to compare structures:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

struct Point {
    int x;
    int y;
};

bool arePointsEqual(struct Point p1, struct Point p2) {
    return (p1.x == p2.x && p1.y == p2.y);
}

int main() {
    struct Point p1 = {1, 2};
    struct Point p2 = {3, 4};
    struct Point p3 = {1, 2};

    if (arePointsEqual(p1, p3)) {
        printf("p1 and p3 are equal\n");
    } else {
        printf("p1 and p3 are not equal\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

#### 3. Initialization

Initializing structures can be verbose and error-prone:

```c
struct Point {
    int x;
    int y;
};

struct Point p1 = {1, 2};  // OK

// For nested structures or arrays of structures
struct Rectangle {
    struct Point topLeft;
    struct Point bottomRight;
};

struct Rectangle rect = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}};  // OK but cumbersome
```

#### 4. Function Parameter Passing

Passing structures by value can be inefficient:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

struct Point {
    int x;
    int y;
};

void printPoint(struct Point p) {
    printf("Point: (%d, %d)\n", p.x, p.y);
}

int main() {
    struct Point p1 = {1, 2};
    printPoint(p1);  // Pass by value, entire structure is copied
    return 0;
}
```

To avoid this, you can pass pointers to structures:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

struct Point {
    int x;
    int y;
};

void printPoint(const struct Point* p) {
    printf("Point: (%d, %d)\n", p->x, p->y);
}

int main() {
    struct Point p1 = {1, 2};
    printPoint(&p1);  // Pass by pointer
    return 0;
}
```

### Extending C Structures with C++

C++ extends C structures with classes, providing many features that address these limitations:

1. **Operator Overloading**: Allowing direct arithmetic and comparison operations on structures.
2. **Constructors and Destructors**: Simplifying initialization and cleanup.
3. **Member Functions**: Allowing functions to be defined within the structure.
4. **Encapsulation**: Using access specifiers to hide internal data.

### Example in C++

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct Point {
    int x;
    int y;

    // Constructor
    Point(int x = 0, int y = 0) : x(x), y(y) {}

    // Operator overloading for addition
    Point operator+(const Point& other) const {
        return Point(x + other.x, y + other.y);
    }

    // Operator overloading for equality
    bool operator==(const Point& other) const {
        return (x == other.x && y == other.y);
    }

    // Member function to print the point
    void print() const {
        cout << "Point: (" << x << ", " << y << ")" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Point p1(1, 2);
    Point p2(3, 4);
    Point p3 = p1 + p2;

    p3.print();

    if (p1 == Point(1, 2)) {
        cout << "p1 is equal to (1, 2)" << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In summary, while C structures have limitations that prevent them from being as flexible as built-in types, C++ classes provide powerful extensions that address these issues, making them more versatile and easier to work with.
