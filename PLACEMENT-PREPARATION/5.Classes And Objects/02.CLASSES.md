### Classes in C++

Classes are a fundamental part of object-oriented programming in C++. They allow you to define custom data types that bundle both data and functions together. This encapsulation helps manage complexity in large programs by grouping related data and functions into a single unit.

### Key Concepts

1. **Class Definition**: The blueprint for creating objects.
2. **Object**: An instance of a class.
3. **Access Specifiers**: Control access to class members (`public`, `private`, `protected`).
4. **Member Functions**: Functions defined inside a class.
5. **Constructors and Destructors**: Special functions for initializing and cleaning up objects.
6. **Inheritance**: Mechanism for creating new classes from existing ones.
7. **Polymorphism**: Ability of functions to behave differently based on the object they are acting upon.
8. **Encapsulation**: Hiding the internal state and requiring all interaction to be performed through an object's methods.
9. **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.

### Class Definition

A class is defined using the `class` keyword followed by the class name and a set of curly braces containing the class members.

```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    int myNumber;             // Data member (attribute)
    void myFunction() {       // Member function (method)
        cout << "Hello World!";
    }
};
```

### Creating Objects

Objects are instances of a class. You create an object by declaring a variable of the class type.

```cpp
int main() {
    MyClass myObj;          // Create an object of MyClass
    myObj.myNumber = 5;     // Access the data member
    myObj.myFunction();     // Call the member function
    return 0;
}
```

### Access Specifiers

Access specifiers define how the members of the class can be accessed. The three access specifiers are:

- **Public**: Members are accessible from outside the class.
- **Private**: Members are accessible only within the class.
- **Protected**: Members are accessible within the class and by derived classes.

### Example

```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    int publicVar;
private:
    int privateVar;
protected:
    int protectedVar;

public:
    void setPrivateVar(int value) {
        privateVar = value;
    }

    int getPrivateVar() {
        return privateVar;
    }
};
```

### Member Functions

Member functions are functions defined inside a class. They can be used to manipulate the data members of the class.

```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    int myNumber;

    void setNumber(int number) {
        myNumber = number;
    }

    int getNumber() {
        return myNumber;
    }
};
```

### Constructors and Destructors

**Constructor**: A special member function that is executed when an object is instantiated. It has the same name as the class and no return type.

**Destructor**: A special member function that is executed when an object is destroyed. It has the same name as the class preceded by a tilde `~`.

```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    int myNumber;

    // Constructor
    MyClass(int number) {
        myNumber = number;
    }

    // Destructor
    ~MyClass() {
        cout << "Object is being deleted" << endl;
    }
};
```

### Inheritance

Inheritance allows one class to inherit attributes and methods from another class.

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    void display() {
        cout << "Base class display" << endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void show() {
        cout << "Derived class show" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Derived obj;
    obj.display();   // Base class function
    obj.show();      // Derived class function
    return 0;
}
```

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows member functions to behave differently based on the object that is invoking them. It can be achieved through function overloading, operator overloading, and virtual functions.

#### Function Overloading

```cpp
class Print {
public:
    void show(int i) {
        cout << "Integer: " << i << endl;
    }

    void show(double f) {
        cout << "Float: " << f << endl;
    }

    void show(string s) {
        cout << "String: " << s << endl;
    }
};
```

#### Operator Overloading

```cpp
class Complex {
private:
    int real, imag;

public:
    Complex(int r = 0, int i = 0) {
        real = r;
        imag = i;
    }

    Complex operator + (const Complex& obj) {
        Complex res;
        res.real = real + obj.real;
        res.imag = imag + obj.imag;
        return res;
    }

    void print() {
        cout << real << " + i" << imag << endl;
    }
};
```

#### Virtual Functions and Runtime Polymorphism

Virtual functions are used to achieve runtime polymorphism. They allow a function to be overridden in derived classes.

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual void display() {
        cout << "Base class display" << endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void display() override {
        cout << "Derived class display" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Base* basePtr;
    Derived derivedObj;
    basePtr = &derivedObj;

    basePtr->display();  // Outputs: Derived class display

    return 0;
}
```

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class). It restricts direct access to some of an object's components.

```cpp
class Encapsulated {
private:
    int x;

public:
    void set(int a) {
        x = a;
    }

    int get() {
        return x;
    }
};

int main() {
    Encapsulated obj;
    obj.set(5);
    cout << obj.get(); // Outputs: 5
    return 0;
}
```

### Abstraction

Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object.

```cpp
class Abstract {
public:
    virtual void display() = 0;  // Pure virtual function
};

class Derived : public Abstract {
public:
    void display() override {
        cout << "Derived class implementation" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Derived obj;
    obj.display();  // Outputs: Derived class implementation

    return 0;
}
```
