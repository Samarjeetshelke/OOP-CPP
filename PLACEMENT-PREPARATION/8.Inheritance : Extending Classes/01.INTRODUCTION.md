### Inheritance in C++

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors (data members and member functions) from another class. The class that is inherited from is called the **base class** or **parent class**, and the class that inherits is called the **derived class** or **child class**.

### Why Use Inheritance?

1. **Reusability**: Code can be reused by inheriting from existing classes.
2. **Extensibility**: New functionalities can be added to existing classes without modifying them.
3. **Maintenance**: Easier to maintain and manage code by organizing related classes hierarchically.

### Types of Inheritance

C++ supports several types of inheritance:

1. **Single Inheritance**: A derived class inherits from a single base class.
2. **Multiple Inheritance**: A derived class inherits from more than one base class.
3. **Multilevel Inheritance**: A class is derived from another derived class.
4. **Hierarchical Inheritance**: Multiple classes inherit from a single base class.
5. **Hybrid Inheritance**: A combination of two or more types of inheritance.

### Visibility Modes

The visibility mode (or access specifier) in inheritance determines the accessibility of the base class members in the derived class. The three visibility modes are:

1. **Public Inheritance**: Public and protected members of the base class become public and protected members of the derived class, respectively. Private members remain inaccessible directly from the derived class.
   
2. **Protected Inheritance**: Public and protected members of the base class become protected members of the derived class. Private members remain inaccessible directly from the derived class.
   
3. **Private Inheritance**: Public and protected members of the base class become private members of the derived class. Private members remain inaccessible directly from the derived class.

### Visibility Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    int publicVar;
protected:
    int protectedVar;
private:
    int privateVar;
};

class PublicDerived : public Base {
public:
    void display() {
        cout << "Public Variable: " << publicVar << endl;       // Accessible
        cout << "Protected Variable: " << protectedVar << endl; // Accessible
        // cout << "Private Variable: " << privateVar << endl; // Not Accessible
    }
};

class ProtectedDerived : protected Base {
public:
    void display() {
        cout << "Public Variable: " << publicVar << endl;       // Accessible
        cout << "Protected Variable: " << protectedVar << endl; // Accessible
        // cout << "Private Variable: " << privateVar << endl; // Not Accessible
    }
};

class PrivateDerived : private Base {
public:
    void display() {
        cout << "Public Variable: " << publicVar << endl;       // Accessible
        cout << "Protected Variable: " << protectedVar << endl; // Accessible
        // cout << "Private Variable: " << privateVar << endl; // Not Accessible
    }
};

int main() {
    PublicDerived publicDerived;
    publicDerived.publicVar = 10; // Accessible
    // publicDerived.protectedVar = 20; // Not Accessible
    // publicDerived.privateVar = 30; // Not Accessible
    publicDerived.display();

    ProtectedDerived protectedDerived;
    // protectedDerived.publicVar = 10; // Not Accessible
    // protectedDerived.protectedVar = 20; // Not Accessible
    protectedDerived.display();

    PrivateDerived privateDerived;
    // privateDerived.publicVar = 10; // Not Accessible
    // privateDerived.protectedVar = 20; // Not Accessible
    privateDerived.display();

    return 0;
}
```

### Types of Inheritance with Examples

#### 1. Single Inheritance

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    void display() {
        cout << "Base class display" << endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void show() {
        cout << "Derived class show" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Derived obj;
    obj.display(); // Base class function
    obj.show();    // Derived class function
    return 0;
}
```

#### 2. Multiple Inheritance

```cpp
class Base1 {
public:
    void display1() {
        cout << "Base1 class display" << endl;
    }
};

class Base2 {
public:
    void display2() {
        cout << "Base2 class display" << endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base1, public Base2 {
public:
    void show() {
        cout << "Derived class show" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Derived obj;
    obj.display1(); // Base1 class function
    obj.display2(); // Base2 class function
    obj.show();     // Derived class function
    return 0;
}
```

#### 3. Multilevel Inheritance

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    void display() {
        cout << "Base class display" << endl;
    }
};

class Intermediate : public Base {
public:
    void showIntermediate() {
        cout << "Intermediate class show" << endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Intermediate {
public:
    void showDerived() {
        cout << "Derived class show" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Derived obj;
    obj.display();          // Base class function
    obj.showIntermediate(); // Intermediate class function
    obj.showDerived();      // Derived class function
    return 0;
}
```

#### 4. Hierarchical Inheritance

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    void display() {
        cout << "Base class display" << endl;
    }
};

class Derived1 : public Base {
public:
    void showDerived1() {
        cout << "Derived1 class show" << endl;
    }
};

class Derived2 : public Base {
public:
    void showDerived2() {
        cout << "Derived2 class show" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Derived1 obj1;
    Derived2 obj2;
    obj1.display();      // Base class function
    obj1.showDerived1(); // Derived1 class function
    obj2.display();      // Base class function
    obj2.showDerived2(); // Derived2 class function
    return 0;
}
```

#### 5. Hybrid Inheritance

Hybrid inheritance is a combination of two or more types of inheritance. It can be complex and lead to ambiguity, especially with multiple inheritance.

### Summary

Inheritance in C++ allows the creation of new classes based on existing ones, promoting code reusability, extensibility, and maintainability. The visibility modes (`public`, `protected`, `private`) in inheritance control the accessibility of base class members in derived classes. Understanding these concepts is crucial for leveraging the full power of object-oriented programming in C++.
