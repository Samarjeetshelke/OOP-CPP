### Inheritance
Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class (derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from another class (base class). This promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between classes.

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    int baseValue;
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    int derivedValue;
};
```

### Abstract Class
An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and often includes one or more pure virtual functions. It is meant to be a base class for other classes.

```cpp
class AbstractBase {
public:
    virtual void pureVirtualFunction() = 0; // Pure virtual function
};

class Derived : public AbstractBase {
public:
    void pureVirtualFunction() override {
        // Implementation
    }
};
```

### Inline Functions
Inline functions are defined with the `inline` keyword and suggest to the compiler to insert the function's body where the function call is made, which can reduce the overhead of a function call.

```cpp
inline int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

### Virtual Functions
Virtual functions allow derived classes to override a function in a base class to provide a specific implementation. They support runtime polymorphism.

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual void show() {
        cout << "Base class" << endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void show() override {
        cout << "Derived class" << endl;
    }
};
```

### Operator Overloading
Operator overloading allows you to redefine the way operators work for user-defined types.

```cpp
class Complex {
    double real, imag;
public:
    Complex(double r, double i) : real(r), imag(i) {}
    Complex operator + (const Complex& other) {
        return Complex(real + other.real, imag + other.imag);
    }
};
```

### Standard Template Library (STL)
STL is a collection of template classes and functions for common data structures and algorithms in C++.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

std::vector<int> vec = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
std::sort(vec.begin(), vec.end());
```

### Data Types
C++ supports various data types, including:
- Primitive types: `int`, `char`, `float`, `double`, etc.
- Derived types: `arrays`, `pointers`, `references`, etc.
- User-defined types: `class`, `struct`, `enum`, `union`, etc.

### Friend Functions
Friend functions are not member functions but have access to the private and protected members of the class.

```cpp
class MyClass {
private:
    int secret;
public:
    friend void showSecret(MyClass &obj);
};

void showSecret(MyClass &obj) {
    cout << obj.secret;
}
```

### Struct vs. Class
In C++, `struct` and `class` are almost identical except for their default access levels:
- `struct`: Members are public by default.
- `class`: Members are private by default.

```cpp
struct MyStruct {
    int x; // Public by default
};

class MyClass {
private:
    int x; // Private by default
};
```

### Implementing Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows you to call derived class methods through a base class pointer or reference.

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual void display() {
        cout << "Base display" << endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void display() override {
        cout << "Derived display" << endl;
    }
};

void show(Base* base) {
    base->display();
}
```

### Access Specifiers
C++ provides three access specifiers:
- `public`: Accessible from anywhere.
- `protected`: Accessible in derived classes.
- `private`: Accessible only within the class.

```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    int publicVar;
protected:
    int protectedVar;
private:
    int privateVar;
};
```

### References vs. Pointers
- **References** are aliases for variables and must be initialized when declared. They cannot be null.
- **Pointers** are variables that hold memory addresses and can be null.

```cpp
int a = 10;
int &ref = a; // Reference
int *ptr = &a; // Pointer
```

### Void Pointers
A void pointer (`void*`) can hold the address of any data type but cannot be dereferenced directly.

```cpp
void* ptr;
int a = 10;
ptr = &a; // Store address of an integer
```

### Block Scope Variable
A block scope variable is declared inside a block (e.g., within `{}`) and is only accessible within that block.

```cpp
void func() {
    int a = 10; // Block scope
    {
        int b = 20; // Block scope within nested block
    }
    // b is not accessible here
}
```

### Copy Constructor
A copy constructor initializes an object using another object of the same class.

```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    int value;
    MyClass(int val) : value(val) {}
    MyClass(const MyClass &obj) : value(obj.value) {}
};
```

### Operators
Operators perform operations on variables and values. C++ supports arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise, assignment, and other operators.

```cpp
int a = 5, b = 10;
int sum = a + b; // Addition operator
bool result = (a < b); // Less than operator
```

### Pointers
Pointers store memory addresses of variables and allow for dynamic memory allocation and array manipulation.

```cpp
int a = 10;
int *ptr = &a; // Pointer to int
```

### Function Overriding
Function overriding allows a derived class to provide a specific implementation of a function that is already defined in its base class.

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual void show() {
        cout << "Base class show" << endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void show() override {
        cout << "Derived class show" << endl;
    }
};
```

### Conversion Constructor
A conversion constructor converts one type to another type within a class.

```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    int value;
    MyClass(int val) : value(val) {} // Conversion constructor
};
```

### Copy vs. Deep Copy
- **Copy (Shallow Copy)**: Copies all member values, including pointers, but does not copy the pointed-to data.
- **Deep Copy**: Copies all member values and makes copies of dynamically allocated memory pointed to by the members.

### Functions
Functions are blocks of code designed to perform a specific task and can return a value.

```cpp
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

### References
References are aliases for other variables and are used for passing arguments to functions to avoid copying.

```cpp
void increment(int &ref) {
    ref++;
}
```

### Static Variables and Functions
- **Static Variables**: Retain their value between function calls and are shared among all instances of a class.
- **Static Functions**: Belong to the class rather than any object instance.

```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    static int count;
    static void incrementCount() {
        count++;
    }
};

int MyClass::count = 0;
```

### Templates
Templates allow writing generic and reusable code for different data types.

```cpp
template <typename T>
T add(T a, T b) {
    return a + b;
}
```
