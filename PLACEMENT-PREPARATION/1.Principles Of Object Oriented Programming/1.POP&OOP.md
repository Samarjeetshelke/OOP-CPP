### Procedural-Oriented Programming (POP)
Procedural-Oriented Programming (POP) is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of procedure calls, where procedures (also known as functions or routines) are the primary building blocks of the program. In POP, the program is divided into small parts called functions. The primary focus is on functions that operate on data, rather than on data itself.

#### Characteristics of POP:
1. **Top-Down Approach**: The program is structured in a top-down manner.
2. **Function-Based**: Programs are divided into functions, and each function performs a specific task.
3. **Global Data**: Data can be shared among functions through global variables.
4. **No Access Specifiers**: There are no access specifiers like `public`, `private`, etc.

#### Example of POP (C):
```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Function declaration
void add(int a, int b);

int main() {
    int num1 = 5, num2 = 10;
    add(num1, num2);
    return 0;
}

// Function definition
void add(int a, int b) {
    int sum = a + b;
    printf("Sum: %d\n", sum);
}
```

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which contain data (attributes) and code (methods) that manipulate the data. OOP emphasizes on objects rather than functions, and it uses classes as blueprints for creating objects.

#### Characteristics of OOP:
1. **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit called a class.
2. **Inheritance**: Creating new classes from existing ones to promote code reuse.
3. **Polymorphism**: Allowing objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class.
4. **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features.
5. **Access Specifiers**: Use of access specifiers (`public`, `private`, `protected`) to control access to class members.

#### Example of OOP (C++):
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Calculator {
private:
    int num1, num2;

public:
    void setNumbers(int a, int b) {
        num1 = a;
        num2 = b;
    }

    int add() {
        return num1 + num2;
    }
};

int main() {
    Calculator calc;
    calc.setNumbers(5, 10);
    cout << "Sum: " << calc.add() << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Differences Between POP and OOP

| Feature                 | Procedural-Oriented Programming (POP)                     | Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)                          |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Approach**            | Top-down                                                  | Bottom-up                                                 |
| **Primary Focus**       | Functions (procedures)                                    | Objects                                                   |
| **Data Handling**       | Data is separate and can be accessed by functions         | Data and functions are encapsulated within objects        |
| **Code Reusability**    | Less emphasis on reusability                              | High emphasis on code reusability through inheritance     |
| **Access Specifiers**   | No access specifiers                                      | Uses access specifiers like `public`, `private`, `protected` |
| **Design**              | Programs are designed as a sequence of function calls     | Programs are designed using classes and objects           |
| **Data Security**       | Data is less secure due to global variables               | Data is more secure due to encapsulation                  |
| **Complexity**          | Suitable for smaller, simpler applications                | Suitable for larger, more complex applications            |
| **Example Language**    | C                                                         | C++, Java, Python                                         |

### Summary
- **POP**: Focuses on functions and procedures. It uses a top-down approach and is suitable for simpler applications. There is no concept of access specifiers or encapsulation.
- **OOP**: Focuses on objects that contain data and methods. It uses a bottom-up approach and is ideal for complex applications. It provides features like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction, along with access specifiers to protect data.

Understanding these paradigms helps in choosing the right approach based on the requirements and complexity of the application being developed.
