C is considered a middle-level programming language because it bridges the gap between high-level and low-level languages. Here's how:

### High-Level Language Features:
- **Abstraction**: C provides abstractions such as functions, structures, and arrays, which allow for more readable and maintainable code compared to low-level languages.
- **Portability**: C code can be compiled and run on various hardware platforms with minimal changes, making it portable across different systems.
- **Standard Libraries**: C includes a standard library that provides a range of functions for common tasks like input/output operations, string handling, and mathematical computations.

### Low-Level Language Features:
- **Direct Memory Access**: C allows direct manipulation of memory through pointers, giving programmers control over memory management.
- **Performance**: C is known for its efficiency and performance, which is closer to that of assembly language. This makes it suitable for system programming and writing operating systems.
- **Hardware Access**: C provides constructs that allow for direct interaction with hardware, such as bitwise operations and inline assembly.

### Example of C Code:
Here's a simple example demonstrating C's middle-level capabilities:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void swap(int *a, int *b) {
    int temp = *a;
    *a = *b;
    *b = temp;
}

int main() {
    int x = 10, y = 20;
    printf("Before swap: x = %d, y = %d\n", x, y);
    swap(&x, &y);
    printf("After swap: x = %d, y = %d\n", x, y);
    return 0;
}
```

In this example:
- The `swap` function demonstrates the use of pointers to directly manipulate memory, a feature typical of low-level languages.
- The `main` function shows how C can be used to write readable, high-level code for application logic.

### Summary:
C is considered a middle-level language because it combines the abstraction and portability of high-level languages with the efficiency and control of low-level languages. This unique combination makes C a versatile language suitable for a wide range of programming tasks, from system programming to application development.
