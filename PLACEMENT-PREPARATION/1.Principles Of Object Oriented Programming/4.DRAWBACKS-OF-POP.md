Procedural-Oriented Programming (POP) has several drawbacks that Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++ overcomes. Here are some key drawbacks of POP and how OOP in C++ addresses them:

### Drawbacks of POP:

1. **Poor Data Encapsulation**:
    - **Problem**: In POP, data is often shared among functions using global variables. This makes the data accessible from anywhere in the program, leading to potential unintentional modifications and difficulty in tracking changes.
    - **OOP Solution**: C++ provides encapsulation by bundling data and methods that operate on the data within classes. Access to data is controlled through access specifiers (`private`, `protected`, `public`), enhancing data security and integrity.

    ```cpp
    class Data {
    private:
        int value;
    public:
        void setValue(int val) { value = val; }
        int getValue() { return value; }
    };
    ```

2. **Lack of Reusability**:
    - **Problem**: POP relies heavily on functions, and code reusability is limited. Functions can be reused, but there's no inherent support for reusing data structures and behavior together.
    - **OOP Solution**: C++ promotes reusability through inheritance, where a new class can inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class. This allows for the reuse and extension of existing code without modification.

    ```cpp
    class Base {
    public:
        void baseFunction() { /*...*/ }
    };

    class Derived : public Base {
    public:
        void derivedFunction() { /*...*/ }
    };
    ```

3. **Difficulty in Managing Large Programs**:
    - **Problem**: As procedural programs grow in size and complexity, managing and understanding the code becomes increasingly difficult. Functions and data can become entangled, leading to maintenance challenges.
    - **OOP Solution**: C++ uses the class structure to organize code into manageable and modular components. Each class represents a specific entity with its data and methods, making large programs easier to understand and maintain.

    ```cpp
    class Car {
    private:
        string model;
        int year;
    public:
        void setDetails(string m, int y) { model = m; year = y; }
        void displayDetails() { cout << "Model: " << model << ", Year: " << year << endl; }
    };
    ```

4. **Poor Abstraction**:
    - **Problem**: Procedural languages often fail to provide sufficient abstraction, requiring programmers to deal with complex details directly.
    - **OOP Solution**: C++ supports abstraction through classes and interfaces, allowing programmers to work with higher-level concepts without needing to manage low-level details.

    ```cpp
    class AbstractDevice {
    public:
        virtual void turnOn() = 0;
        virtual void turnOff() = 0;
    };

    class Fan : public AbstractDevice {
    public:
        void turnOn() override { cout << "Fan is On" << endl; }
        void turnOff() override { cout << "Fan is Off" << endl; }
    };
    ```

5. **No Polymorphism**:
    - **Problem**: Procedural languages lack polymorphism, making it difficult to design flexible and reusable code that can work with different data types and behaviors.
    - **OOP Solution**: C++ supports polymorphism, allowing objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. This enables dynamic method binding and more flexible and reusable code.

    ```cpp
    class Shape {
    public:
        virtual void draw() = 0;
    };

    class Circle : public Shape {
    public:
        void draw() override { cout << "Drawing Circle" << endl; }
    };

    class Square : public Shape {
    public:
        void draw() override { cout << "Drawing Square" << endl; }
    };

    void render(Shape *shape) {
        shape->draw();
    }
    ```

6. **Tight Coupling**:
    - **Problem**: In POP, functions often operate on shared global data, leading to tight coupling between functions and data. This makes the code less modular and harder to modify or extend.
    - **OOP Solution**: C++ promotes loose coupling through encapsulation and modularity. Classes encapsulate data and provide interfaces for interaction, reducing dependencies between different parts of the program.

    ```cpp
    class Engine {
    public:
        void start() { cout << "Engine started" << endl; }
    };

    class Car {
    private:
        Engine engine;
    public:
        void startCar() { engine.start(); }
    };
    ```

### Summary:
OOP in C++ addresses many of the drawbacks of POP by providing features like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. These features promote better data security, code reusability, maintainability, and flexibility, making it easier to manage large and complex programs.
