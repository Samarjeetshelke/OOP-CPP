In C++, the terms "constant" and "literal constant" are often used interchangeably, but they refer to slightly different concepts. Here's a breakdown of the differences:

### Literal Constants
Literal constants (or literals) are fixed values directly embedded in the code. They represent specific values and are not associated with any identifier. There are several types of literal constants in C++ and They do not have memory locations:

1. **Integer Literals**: 
   ```cpp
   42, 0, -7
   ```
2. **Floating-point Literals**:
   ```cpp
   3.14, -0.001, 2.0
   ```
3. **Character Literals**:
   ```cpp
   'a', 'Z', '\n'
   ```
4. **String Literals**:
   ```cpp
   "Hello, World!", "C++"
   ```
5. **Boolean Literals**:
   ```cpp
   true, false
   ```
6. **Pointer Literal**:
   ```cpp
   nullptr
   ```

### Constants
Constants, on the other hand, are identifiers whose values cannot be changed once they are defined. Constants can be defined using the `const` keyword or `constexpr` keyword, or they can be created using enumerations (`enum`).

#### Using `const`:
```cpp
const int maxVal = 100;
const float pi = 3.14159;
```

#### Using `constexpr`:
`constexpr` is a more restrictive form of `const` which ensures that the value is constant and can be evaluated at compile-time.
```cpp
constexpr int maxVal = 100;
constexpr float pi = 3.14159;
```

#### Enumerations:
```cpp
enum { red, green, blue };
const int redValue = red; // redValue will be 0
```

### Key Differences
1. **Definition**:
   - **Literal Constants**: Fixed values written directly in the code. They are not associated with any identifier.
   - **Constants**: Identifiers (variables) whose values cannot be changed after initialization. They are defined using the `const` or `constexpr` keyword or using enumerations.

2. **Examples**:
   - **Literal Constants**: 
     ```cpp
     42, 3.14, 'a', "Hello, World!"
     ```
   - **Constants**: 
     ```cpp
     const int maxVal = 100;
     constexpr float pi = 3.14159;
     ```

3. **Usage**:
   - **Literal Constants**: Used directly in expressions and statements.
     ```cpp
     int x = 42;
     float y = 3.14 * x;
     ```
   - **Constants**: Used as symbolic names for literal values to make the code more readable and maintainable.
     ```cpp
     const int maxVal = 100;
     for (int i = 0; i < maxVal; ++i) {
         // Do something
     }
     ```

### Benefits of Using Constants
- **Readability**: Using named constants makes the code easier to understand.
  ```cpp
  const int maxConnections = 10;
  for (int i = 0; i < maxConnections; ++i) {
      // Do something
  }
  ```
  This is more readable than:
  ```cpp
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
      // Do something
  }
  ```

- **Maintainability**: If you need to change the value, you only have to change it in one place.
  ```cpp
  const int bufferSize = 256;
  char buffer[bufferSize];
  ```

In summary, literal constants are fixed values embedded directly in the code, while constants are identifiers for fixed values defined using `const`, `constexpr`, or enumerations. Constants improve code readability and maintainability by providing meaningful names for values.
