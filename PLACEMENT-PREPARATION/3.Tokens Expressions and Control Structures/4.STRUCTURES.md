In both C and C++, structures (`struct`) are used to group different types of variables under a single name. This is particularly useful for creating complex data types that represent real-world entities.
Standalone variables of primitive types are not sufficient enough to handle real world problems.in is often required to group logically related data items together. While arrays are used to grp together similar type data , structure are used to store the disimilier type of data.
### Structures in C

In C, a structure is defined using the `struct` keyword followed by a structure name and a block containing the member variables.

#### Defining a Structure

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Define a structure
struct Person {
    char name[50];
    int age;
    float height;
};

int main() {
    // Declare a structure variable
    struct Person person1;

    // Access and assign values to the structure members
    strcpy(person1.name, "John Doe");
    person1.age = 30;
    person1.height = 5.9;

    // Access and print structure members
    printf("Name: %s\n", person1.name);
    printf("Age: %d\n", person1.age);
    printf("Height: %.1f\n", person1.height);

    return 0;
}
```

### Structures in C++

In C++, structures are similar to C but come with additional features. Structures in C++ can have member functions, access specifiers (public, private, protected), and can be used with object-oriented programming features.

#### Defining a Structure

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring> // For strcpy
using namespace std;

// Define a structure
struct Person {
    char name[50];
    int age;
    float height;

    // Member function to print person details
    void printDetails() {
        cout << "Name: " << name << endl;
        cout << "Age: " << age << endl;
        cout << "Height: " << height << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Declare a structure variable
    Person person1;

    // Access and assign values to the structure members
    strcpy(person1.name, "John Doe");
    person1.age = 30;
    person1.height = 5.9;

    // Access and print structure members
    person1.printDetails();

    return 0;
}
```

### Key Differences between Structures in C and C++

1. **Member Functions**: In C++, structures can have member functions.
   ```cpp
   struct Person {
       char name[50];
       int age;
       float height;

       void printDetails() {
           cout << "Name: " << name << endl;
           cout << "Age: " << age << endl;
           cout << "Height: " << height << endl;
       }
   };
   ```

2. **Access Specifiers**: In C++, structures can have access specifiers like `public`, `private`, and `protected`. By default, all members of a `struct` are `public`.
   ```cpp
   struct Person {
   private:
       char name[50];
       int age;
       float height;

   public:
       void setDetails(const char* n, int a, float h) {
           strcpy(name, n);
           age = a;
           height = h;
       }

       void printDetails() {
           cout << "Name: " << name << endl;
           cout << "Age: " << age << endl;
           cout << "Height: " << height << endl;
       }
   };
   ```

3. **Inheritance**: In C++, structures can inherit from other structures or classes, supporting object-oriented programming.
   ```cpp
   struct Person {
       char name[50];
       int age;
       float height;

       void printDetails() {
           cout << "Name: " << name << endl;
           cout << "Age: " << age << endl;
           cout << "Height: " << height << endl;
       }
   };

   struct Employee : Person {
       int employeeID;
       void printEmployeeID() {
           cout << "Employee ID: " << employeeID << endl;
       }
   };
   ```

4. **Default Access Specifier**: In C, the default access specifier for `struct` members is `public`, while in C++, the default access specifier for `class` members is `private`. For `struct` in C++, it remains `public`.

### Example of Using Structures in C++

Here's a more complex example demonstrating the use of member functions and access specifiers:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;

struct Person {
private:
    char name[50];
    int age;
    float height;

public:
    // Member function to set details
    void setDetails(const char* n, int a, float h) {
        strcpy(name, n);
        age = a;
        height = h;
    }

    // Member function to print details
    void printDetails() {
        cout << "Name: " << name << endl;
        cout << "Age: " << age << endl;
        cout << "Height: " << height << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Declare a structure variable
    Person person1;

    // Set details using member function
    person1.setDetails("John Doe", 30, 5.9);

    // Print details using member function
    person1.printDetails();

    return 0;
}
```

This example shows the use of private member variables and public member functions to encapsulate and manage the structure's data, demonstrating a key aspect of object-oriented programming in C++.
