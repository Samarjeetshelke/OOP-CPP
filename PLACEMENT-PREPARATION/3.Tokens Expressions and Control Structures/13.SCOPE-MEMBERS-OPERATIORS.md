In C++ programming, the operators `::`, `::*`, `->*`, and `.*` are used for various purposes, primarily related to accessing and manipulating class members, particularly when dealing with member functions and pointers to members. Here's a detailed explanation of each:

### 1. `::` (Scope Resolution Operator)

The `::` operator is used to qualify or access elements within a namespace or class scope. It has multiple uses:

- **Global Scope Resolution**: Access global variables or functions when there is a local variable or function with the same name.
  
  ```cpp
  int x = 10;

  namespace A {
      int x = 20;
      void display() {
          int x = 30;
          cout << "Local x: " << x << endl;       // Local x: 30
          cout << "Namespace A x: " << A::x << endl;  // Namespace A x: 20
          cout << "Global x: " << ::x << endl;    // Global x: 10
      }
  }
  ```

- **Accessing Static Members**: Access static variables or functions of a class without an instance.

  ```cpp
  class MyClass {
  public:
      static int count;
  };

  int MyClass::count = 0;

  int main() {
      cout << MyClass::count << endl; // Accessing static member using ::
      return 0;
  }
  ```

- **Nested Classes**: Accessing members of nested classes.

  ```cpp
  class Outer {
  public:
      class Inner {
      public:
          void display() {
              cout << "Inner class method" << endl;
          }
      };
  };

  int main() {
      Outer::Inner obj;
      obj.display(); // Calling method of inner class
      return 0;
  }
  ```

### 2. `::*` (Pointer to Member Operator)

The `::*` operator is used to declare pointers to non-static member functions or data members of a class. It allows indirect access to class members through pointers.

- **Pointer to Member Function**:

  ```cpp
  class MyClass {
  public:
      void display() {
          cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
      }
  };

  int main() {
      void (MyClass::*funcPtr)() = &MyClass::display;
      MyClass obj;
      (obj.*funcPtr)(); // Calling member function through pointer
      return 0;
  }
  ```

### 3. `->*` (Pointer to Member Access Operator)

The `->*` operator is used with pointers to objects that have member functions or data members. It is used to access member functions or data members through a pointer to the object.

- **Pointer to Member Function**:

  ```cpp
  class MyClass {
  public:
      void display() {
          cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
      }
  };

  int main() {
      MyClass obj;
      MyClass* ptr = &obj;
      void (MyClass::*funcPtr)() = &MyClass::display;
      (ptr->*funcPtr)(); // Calling member function through pointer
      return 0;
  }
  ```

### 4. `.*` (Member Access through Pointer)

The `.*` operator is used with an object and a pointer to a member of that object, allowing access to the member through the object.

- **Pointer to Member Function**:

  ```cpp
  class MyClass {
  public:
      void display() {
          cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
      }
  };

  int main() {
      MyClass obj;
      MyClass* ptr = &obj;
      void (MyClass::*funcPtr)() = &MyClass::display;
      (obj.*funcPtr)(); // Calling member function through object
      return 0;
  }
  ```

### Summary

- **::**: Used for namespace resolution, accessing static members, and nested class members.
- **::***: Declares pointers to non-static member functions or data members of a class.
- **->***: Accesses member functions or data members through pointers to objects.
- **.***: Accesses member functions or data members directly through objects.

These operators provide powerful capabilities in C++ for working with classes, enabling indirect access to member functions and data members through pointers, and facilitating namespace management and static member access. Understanding these operators is crucial for advanced C++ programming, particularly in scenarios involving object-oriented programming and class hierarchies.
